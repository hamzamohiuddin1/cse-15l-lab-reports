1. cd command: In ~/lecture1  
No arguments:   
  [user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ cd  
Output:  
  [user@sahara ~]$  
Explanation:  
This command put me back into the root directory ~, which is what the computer does when you run cd with no arguments. Since you are specifying an "empty" directory, it puts you in the root directory.
