Hamza Mohiuddin Week 1 Lab Report

1. cd command: All being run in ~/lecture1
   
No arguments:   
  ```[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ cd```   
Output:  
  ```[user@sahara ~]$```  
Explanation:  
This command put me back into the root directory ~, which is what the computer does when you run cd with no arguments. Since you are specifying an "empty" directory, it puts you in the root directory.

With a directory path for an argument:    
  ```[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ cd ./messages```  
Output:    
  ```[user@sahara ~/lecture1/messages]$```   
Explanation:    
Since I was in the ~/lecture1 directory and the messages directory existed inside lecture1, I was able to cd into ~/lecture1/messages, a subdirectory of my previous working directory.
